# Predictive-Modelling-of-Phishing-Website-Detection

Phishing websites are a popular social engineering technique that imitates reliable addresses and online sites. The goal of this project is to extract important properties from URLs, turn those features into a dataset, then use that dataset to train machine learning models and deep neural networks to identify phishing websites. A sample of legitimate URLs is provided from the University of New Brunswick, while the data on phishing URLs is gathered from an open-source program called PhishTank. For the project, a subset of 5000 phishing URLs and 5000 legitimate URLs are chosen. Total of 17 (seventeen) features are extracted from the URLs dataset, which are categorized into address bar-based features, domain-based features, and HTML and JavaScript-based features. This dataset has been used to train various machine learning models and deep neural nets. The performance level of each model is measured and compared.
